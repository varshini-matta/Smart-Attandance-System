# Smart-Attendance-System
This is a Smart Attendance System project using Open CV python
<br>
Managing student attendance is a complex task prone to inefficiencies and inaccuracies.
Traditional methods, such as manual name-calling, are time-consuming and susceptible to
proxy attendance. In response to these challenges, we present an innovative attendance
management system based on face recognition technology. This system aims to streamline
the attendance recording process, eliminate the risk of proxy attendance, and enhance
overall efficiency.
<br>
Our system records daily attendance subject-wise, with predefined student information
stored securely by the administrator. As each subject's session begins, the system
autonomously captures images, applying advanced face detection and recognition
techniques. Deep learning methodologies, including the Histogram of Oriented Gradients
(HOG) method, are employed to detect faces in images. OpenCV in Python, along with
artificial intelligence algorithms, is used to compute and compare facial features, enabling
accurate student recognition.
<br>
The system excels in the real-time identification of multiple faces, providing a robust solution
for attendance tracking. Recognized students are automatically marked as present, with
their attendance updated in real-time, including the corresponding time and subject
identification. The integration of deep learning technologies ensures the reliability and
efficiency of our system, making it a viable and effective tool for modern attendance
management.
